<p>Intrpretr allows for people who don&#39;t speak English well to access assistance for events in their daily lives that might require a specialized English vocabulary, such as a trip to the doctor or to open a bank account.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>I used to live in Japan, and there was always a huge amount of stress involved whenever I had to deal with doctors, the bank, the post office, etc., because very few businesses there have any foreign language support. This meant that I would have to put off important things, as I had to rely on the mercy of my supervisor and the openness of their schedule. The only business with foreign language support was my cell phone provider, who provided a Skype translator.</p>
<p>Apart from my personal experience living abroad, the world is also undergoing the biggest displacement of human beings since World War II. These refugees didn&#39;t have the benefit of 4+ years of college Japanese like I had, they might have to move to a country they barely knew of, and know absolutely none of the language. This service would make it easier for them to access medical, financial, and governmental services.</p>
